# CSVis
  A Unity based CSV data visualizer application for creating and viewing data plots in mixed reality through the Microsoft HoloLens. 

  The application uses the open source [Data Visualization Toolkit](https://github.com/jman19/DataVisualizationPlotter) and the 
  [MixedRealityToolkit-Unity](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases) by Microsoft to plot 3D data in Mixed Reality space to offer a different perspective in viewing 3D data.

## What can it do?
  1. Load premade example plots using the DVT porject and shocase it's useage through the HoloLnes
  1. CSVis can also plot static 2D / 3D data plots from predefined examples
  1. Plots created can also be manipulated with hand gestures for placement of the plots in your surroundings
