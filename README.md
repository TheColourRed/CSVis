  The application uses the open source [Data Visualization Toolkit](https://github.com/jman19/DataVisualizationPlotter) and the 
  [MixedRealityToolkit-Unity](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases) by Microsoft to plot 3D data in Mixed Reality space to offer a different perspective in viewing 3D data.

## What can it do?
  1. Load premade example plots using the DVT porject and shocase it's useage through the HoloLnes
  1. CSVis can also plot static 2D / 3D data plots from predefined examples
  1. Plots created can also be manipulated with hand gestures for placement of the plots in your surroundings
 
The types of plots that are supported by the DVT are:
